This Api is built around the game Rainbow Six Siege. It includes a variety of detailed endpoints with referencing. At the moment is holds 42 operators, 20 maps, all of their unique abilites, gadgets, and weapons.

This api is currently under maintence for extended endpoints that will be more restful and easier to call needed data.
